# HappyTidings

## Overview
In this project, I developed a comments app that enables people to share happy updates with each other and delete the comments on double click. The app incorporates a database using Firebase, which allows users to add and delete comments using unique identifiers.

## Deployed Link
Production link pending...PLEASE NOTE: to avoid spamming I updated the 'write' rules to false, so the user can only read and view the app currently.
